			<h3>What am I here for</h3>
			<p>
			The purpose of a <em>gasoline car engine</em> is to convert gasoline into motion so that your car can move. Currently the easiest way to create motion from gasoline is to burn the gasoline inside an engine. Therefore, a car engine is an <em>internal combustion engine</em> &#8211; combustion takes place internally.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar6">
			<h3>The Otto</h3>
			<p>
			Almost all cars currently use what is called a <em>four-stroke combustion cycle</em> to convert gasoline into motion. The four-stroke approach is also known as the Otto cycle, in honor of <em>Nikolaus Otto</em>, who invented it in 1867. <li>Intake stroke</li> <li>Compression stroke</li> <li>Combustion stroke</li> <li>Exhaust stroke</li>

			<h3>My Heart</h3>
			<p>
			The core of the engine is the <em>cylinder</em>, with the <em>piston</em> moving up and down inside the cylinder. In a <em>multi-cylinder engine</em>, the cylinders usually are arranged in one of three ways: inline, V or flat. <br><br>Different configurations have different advantages and disadvantages in terms of smoothness, manufacturing cost and shape characteristics.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar8">
			<h3>Other Powers</h3>
			<p>
			The electrical system consists of a battery and an alternator. The <em>alternator</em> is connected to the engine by a belt and generates electricity to recharge the battery. The <em>battery</em> makes 12-volt power available to everything in the car needing electricity through the vehicle's wiring. <br><li>The ignition system</li> <li>Radio</li> <li>Headlights</li><li>Windshield wipers</li> <li>Power windows</li> <li>Seats</li> <li>Computers</li>

			<h3>Highways of the Future</h3>
			<p>
			The <em>solar highways</em> consist of individual panels with three layers &#8211; a top layer of high-strength, textured glass that provides traction for vehicles, an array of <em>solar cells</em> beneath that for gathering energy, and a base plate that distributes the collected power.</p>
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar6">
			<h3>Cost &amp; Efficiency</h3>
			<p>
			Each panel costs about <em>$7,000</em> to build. The cost of repairing these solar panels is likely more expensive than it would be for fixing ordinary, asphalt roads. Solar Roadways could produce over <em>three times</em> the electricity that we currently use in the United States.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar7">
			<h3>It's Electric</h3>
			<p>
			Electric cars run on <em>rechargeable batteries</em> rather than fuel. They cause about <em>97% less pollution</em> than regular cars! Tomorrow's cars may have long-range headlights, external airbags and hydrogen fuel-cell engines that emit only water.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar8">
			<h3>I Can Drive Myself</h3>
			<p>
			<em>Autonomous cars</em> are expected to be on the road within 10 years! Autonomous vehicles are capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. New technology in the next 5 to 10 years will help cars park themselves, monitor the alertness of the driver and even communicate with each other to avoid collisions.

		<article id="oldcar5">
			<h3>Take the Train</h3>
			<p>
			Operators control the train by using the throttle, reversing gear and brake. The <em>throttle</em> controls the speed of the locomotive. The <em>reversing gear</em> enables the locomotive to back up. The <em>brake</em> allows the locomotive to slow and stop. 
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar6">
			<h3>Under the Hood</h3>
			<p>
			All railroad cars have an <em>undercarriage</em> that contains wheels and a <em>suspension system</em> to buffer the ride. On each end of the undercarriage, <em>couplers</em>, which are like hooks, connect the cars.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar7">
			<h3>Railway Design</h3>
			<p>
			Track design and construction is part of a complex and multi-disciplinary engineering science involving earthworks, steelwork, timber and suspension systems - the <em>infrastructure</em> of the railway. To give a train a good ride, the track alignment must be set to within a millimeter of the design. 
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar8">
			<h3>Railway Composition</h3>
			<p>
			Modern track typically uses hot rolled steel with a profile of an asymmetrical rounded <em>I-beam</em>. Railway rails are subject to very high stresses and have to be made of <em>very high-quality steel alloy</em>. The usual track form consists of the two steel rails, secured on sleepers (or crossties) so as to keep the rails at the correct distance apart (the gauge) and capable of supporting the weight of trains.

			<h3>Maglev Trains</h3>
			<p>
			Germany and Japan are both developing <em>Maglev</em> train technology, and both are currently testing prototypes of their trains. The trains can reach <em>300 mph</em> with people onboard.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar6">
			<h3>The Track</h3>
			<p>
			The <em>magnetized coil</em> running along the track, called a <em>guideway</em>, repels the large magnets on the train's undercarriage, allowing the train to levitate between 0.39 and 3.93 inches (1 to 10 cm) above the guideway. 
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar7">
			<h3>Hovering</h3>
			<p>
			Instead of wheels and rails, Maglev trains hover above the tracks &#8211; or guideways &#8211; levitated and propelled by <em>magnetic force</em>. There is no physical contact between the train and the <em>guideway</em>, which eliminates friction and enables high speeds. The base of the train wraps around the guideway and cannot derail.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar8">
			<h3>Hyperloop Trains</h3>
			<p>
			One of the most exciting innovations in transportation has to be the <em>Hyperloop train</em>. Rising on nearly airless tubes at <em>800 mph</em>, the train will transport you from LA to San Francisco in just <em>30 minutes</em>. Elon Musk announced a design scheme back in August [2013].

		<article id="oldcar5">
			<h3>Plane Mechanics</h3>
			<p>
			<em>Thrust</em>, whether caused by a propeller or a jet engine, is the aerodynamic force that pushes or pulls the airplane forward through space. The opposing aerodynamic force is <em>drag</em>, or the friction that resists the motion of an object moving through a fluid.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar6">
			<h3>Navigating</h3>
			<p>
			The tail of the airplane has two types of small wings, called the <em>horizontal and vertical stabilizers</em>. A pilot uses these surfaces to control the direction of the plane. Both types of stabilizer are symmetrical airfoils, and both have large flaps to alter <em>airflow</em>.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar7">
			<h3>The Dreamliner</h3>
			<p>
			The <em>787 Dreamliner</em> applies breakthrough technologies to an all-new airplane design. The advanced features of the 787 increase efficiency and significantly improves the air travel experience. The Dreamliner produces <em>60%</em> less noise, consumes <em>20%</em> less fuel, and produces fewer emissions than aircraft of comparable size. 
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar8">
			<h3>Airflow</h3>
			<p>
			The 787's simple <em>pivot trailing edge flaps</em> allow for much smaller flap track fairings. This gives the airplane highly efficient <em>lift-to-drag</em> characteristics that reduce fuel consumption and costs. The simple pivot trailing edge has fewer parts for reduced maintenance and provides a lighter and simpler high-lift system without sacrificing performance.

			<h3>Breaking into Orbit</h3>
			<p>
			It costs approximately <em>$450 million</em> to send a rocket to space! Rockets work by burning fuel. As fuel burns and swells out behind, the swelling pushes the rocket forward.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar6">
			<h3>X-Planes</h3>
			<p>
			Currently there are several experimental <em>X-plane models</em> in development that could make space travel as routine as airplane travel. NASA&#39;s Deep Space-1 project is based on <em>xenon ion engines</em> which thrust electrically charged particles called ions, not hot gases, out of the back of the craft.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar7">
			<h3>Fuel Rockets</h3>
			<p>
			<em>Solid-fuel rockets</em> are the oldest of all engines, used by the Chinese a thousand years ago. Rockets provide the huge thrust needed to beat the pull of Earth&#39;s gravity and launch a spacecraft into space. Rockets burn <em>propellant</em> (propel means &#39;push&#39;), to produce hot gases that drive the rocket upwards. Rocket propellant comes in two parts &#8211; a solid or liquid fuel, and an oxidizer. 
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="oldcar8">
			<h3>Keep it Moving</h3>
			<p>
			There is no oxygen in space, and the <em>oxidizer</em> (reactant that removes electrons from other reactants during a redox reaction) supplies the oxygen needed to burn fuel. It is usually liquid oxygen (called &#39;lox&#39; for short).
